# Dockerized Banking Application

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Dockerized Banking Application built using Spring Boot and MySQL. It showcases containerization techniques using Docker and Docker Compose to manage services efficiently.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An **AWS account**
- A **t2.medium EC2 instance** for better performance
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your EC2 instance

## Key Features

- **Containerization:** Multi-stage Docker builds for improved performance
- **Service Management:** Simplified deployment using Docker Compose
- **Persistent Storage:** MySQL database configured with persistent storage

## Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Multi-Stage Dockerfile**
   - A sample Dockerfile is included for building the Spring Boot application.

3. **Docker Compose Setup**
   - A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided to manage the MySQL and Spring Boot application services.

4. **Run Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Stop and Remove Containers (if needed)**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Accessing the Application

Once the application is running, you can access it via the public IP of your EC2 instance on port 8080:

```
http://<EC2-instance-public-IP>:8080
```

## Detailed Guide
